### Predictive Analysis of Payment Delays for Raiffeisen Bank Using EDA and Machine Learning

This project analyzes the factors contributing to loan payment delays among Raiffeisen Bank clients. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning classification algorithms, the aim is to predict future delays and provide actionable recommendations for risk management.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Identify the main causes of delayed payments and build predictive models to help Raiffeisen Bank manage risks more effectively.
- **Dataset**: Contains information on clients, payment behavior, and service usage. 
- **Methods**: Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).

## Key Findings
- **Customer Service Calls**: Higher frequency of calls correlates with delayed payments.
- **Usage Patterns**: High usage, especially during peak hours, is linked to increased likelihood of delays.
- **International Plans**: Clients with international plans show a slightly higher risk of delayed payments.

## Machine Learning Models
- **Algorithms Used**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- **Best Performing Model**: [Specify the model] with an accuracy of [insert accuracy]% due to its ability to balance precision and recall effectively.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/username/Raiffeisen_Payment_Delays_Analysis.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**: Open the notebook and execute cells to explore the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly

## Future Work
